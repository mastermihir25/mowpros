<div><div style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;"><div style="color:#606; font-size:24px;"><p>What to Expect</p></div><div style="height:400px; padding-right:8px; overflow:auto;" <p=""><strong style="color:#606;">MOWING SEASON</strong>
 - Our regularly scheduled season for weekly or bi-weekly lawn service 
is March through November.  During the winter we provide 2 services in 
December, and 1 service each for January and February.  You may suspend 
mowing after November to resume in March if you like, however we 
recommend keeping these services scheduled to ensure your yard looks 
good through the winter months as well and to keep the leaves from 
building up.  Customers may request additional services in the winter if
 they wish.<p></p><p><strong style="color:#606;">MOW DAY</strong> - You 
will be given a mow day which you can expect us to come on each week of 
service.  We are very reliable on coming on the same day each week and 
usually at the same time of day as well.  If there are any changes to 
your mow day this will be communicated to you several days prior.</p><p><strong style="color:#606;">RAIN DAYS</strong>
 - If we have a rainy day and are unable to come out, then you can 
expect us to come the next day that it isn't raining.  The schedule for 
that entire week will be slid a day due to that rain event.</p><p><strong style="color:#606;">COMMUNICATION</strong>
 - We strive to ensure easy and effective communication.  If you have 
any requests, you can email us or call the office.  Please don't try to 
communicate requests to the crew.  Our ability to ensure your requests 
are scheduled effectively and continuously honored on future services 
depends on us knowing what you want.  These requests and directions are 
noted on your account so that we can ensure they are complied with on 
future services as well.</p><p><strong style="color:#606;">PAYMENTS</strong>
 - Payment for service is conveniently billed to your debit or credit 
card the business day after your designated mow day, continuously, until
 you cancel service. Although we are very punctual, keep in mind that 
your bank does not always post the charge on your account the exact day 
we process payments. We accept Mastercard or Visa. We do not accept 
checks or cash.</p><p><strong style="color:#606;">PRICING</strong> - Our
 prices are based on your lot size and include mowing front, back and 
sides, edging, weed eating, and blowing the area clean.  It also 
includes the alley behind the house.  Hedge trimming and any work in the
 flower beds are available upon request and are not included in the 
basic lawn service pricing.  Bi-weekly prices are $10 extra.  Go to the 
"Get Quote" page for your specific price for lawn service.</p><p><strong style="color:#606;">HEDGE TRIMMING AND FLOWER BEDS</strong>
 - We offer services for hedge trimming and flower beds including 
weeding, mulching, and planting flowers.  The pricing on these services 
is $99/hr plus materials (Mulch or Flowers) for a 2 man crew.</p><p><strong style="color:#606;">SKIPS</strong>
 - We provide for up to 3 skips per year for our weekly customers.  We 
do not make this allowance for bi-weekly yards due to the time and grass
 growth between mowing.  We require a 48 hour notification in order to 
ensure you are taken off the schedule.</p><p><strong style="color:#606;">CUSTOMER SATISFACTION</strong>
 - We strive for your complete satisfaction with every service provided.
 While we are unable to give refunds or credits, we will send the crew 
back to correct any reasonable service issues, without any additional 
charges, provided that you contact us within 24 hours of the service. 
After 24 hours, we will consider the work satisfactory. If you contact 
us after 24 hours, we will address your complaint so that it will be 
corrected on your next service.  We are not able to extend this policy 
to bi-weekly service.</p><p><strong style="color:#606;">Bi-WEEKLY SERVICE</strong>
 - Bi-weekly services are offered, but are not recommended, especially 
in the faster growing portion of the season (May - August). Your grass 
growth may vary due to a variety of conditions, i.e. watering and 
fertilizing schedules, etc.  Also, we will not cut the grass shorter 
than industry accepted standards, which recommends only cutting 1/3 off 
the grass height each mowing. Bi-weekly servicing lends itself to such 
problems as the following: thatch build-up, grass clumps, excessive 
grass clippings, grass lines or ridges which appear that we skipped 
while mowing, and the appearance of an uneven cut in the yard. We will 
not be able to send crews back to correct these issues or guarantee 
these services like we do on our weekly services.</p><p><strong style="color:#606;">GATES</strong>
 - Your gate must remain unlocked for the full day of your regularly 
scheduled service. If you prefer not to unlock your gate, we recommend 
that you use combo locks and that you provide us with the password or 
combination.</p><p><strong style="color:#606;">PETS</strong> - Our crews
 are very careful to avoid pets escaping, however we do not assume 
responsibility.  It is recommended that pets be leashed or kept inside 
during your mow day.</p><p><strong style="color:#606;">CANCELLATION</strong> - We have a 6 mow minimum.  After this you can suspend service or cancel at any time.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></div></div>
